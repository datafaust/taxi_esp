```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)

setwd("C:\\Users\\lopezf\\Desktop\\regression_test\\regression_test")
master = fread("master_raw.csv")[,-1]

```

## Starting with Trends


```{r trends}

#look at trips per day by zone
daily_volume = master[,.(shl_volume = sum(trips_shl)
          ,yellow_volume = sum(trips_med)), by = .(dayz=substr(timestampz, 1, 10))][
            ,total_volume:=shl_volume + yellow_volume]


ggplot(daily_volume, aes(x = dayz, y = total_volume)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")





```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
